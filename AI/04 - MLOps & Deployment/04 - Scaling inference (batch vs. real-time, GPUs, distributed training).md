# ‚ö° Scaling Inference: Batch vs Real-time, GPUs, Distributed Training  

## 1. Why Care About Scaling Inference?  

Imagine opening a burger shop üçî.  
- If 5 people show up ‚Üí you‚Äôre fine.  
- If 5,000 show up at once ‚Üí you need serious scaling!  

üëâ Same for ML models: inference at scale = key to production success.  

---  

## 2. Two Modes of Inference  

### Batch Inference üóÇÔ∏è  
- Process many inputs at once (offline).  
- Examples: nightly fraud risk scores, recommendation pre-computation.  

```
[Big dataset] ---> [Batch job] ---> [Predictions stored in DB]
```  

- ‚úÖ Efficient for large datasets.  
- ‚ùå High latency (not real-time).  

### Real-time Inference ‚ö°  
- Handle one request at a time, respond immediately.  
- Examples: chatbots, credit card fraud checks, personalized ads.  

```
[User Request] ---> [API/Model] ---> [Instant Response]
```  

- ‚úÖ Low latency.  
- ‚ùå Requires scalable serving infrastructure.  

---  

## 3. Accelerating with GPUs üéÆ  

- CPUs good for small loads.  
- GPUs excel at **parallel matrix operations** ‚Üí speedups for deep nets.  
- Frameworks: TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, Torch-TensorRT.  

```python
# Example: PyTorch inference on GPU
import torch
model = torch.jit.load("model_traced.pt")
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model.to(device)

x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    y = model(x)
```  

- ‚úÖ Great for deep learning workloads.  
- ‚ùå Expensive, needs batching to maximize throughput.  

---  

## 4. Distributed Inference üñß  

When one machine/GPU isn‚Äôt enough:  
- **Horizontal scaling**: replicate model across servers.  
- **Model parallelism**: split model across GPUs.  
- **Data parallelism**: split data across GPUs/nodes.  

### Tools  
- Ray Serve, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving, NVIDIA Triton.  
- Kubernetes for orchestration.  

```python
# Example: Ray Serve (scaling with multiple replicas)
from ray import serve

@serve.deployment(num_replicas=3)
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        import joblib
        self.model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
    def __call__(self, request):
        data = request.json()
        pred = self.model.predict([list(data.values())])
        return {"prediction": int(pred[0])}

serve.run(Model.bind())
```

## 5. Text Diagram: Scaling Options  

```
Batch Inference ‚Üí Offline, efficient, high throughput  
Real-time      ‚Üí Online, low latency, user-facing  
GPUs           ‚Üí Speed up heavy models  
Distributed    ‚Üí Multiple nodes/GPUs for scale  
```  

---  

## 6. Challenges ‚ö†Ô∏è  

- **Latency vs Throughput** trade-offs.  
- **Cost optimization**: GPUs expensive, use autoscaling.  
- **Load balancing** for real-time APIs.  
- **Monitoring**: latency, error rates, GPU utilization.  

---  

## 7. Game Time üé≤  

Q: Your model processes **1M transactions nightly** ‚Üí batch or real-time?  
üëâ Answer: **Batch inference**.  

Q: Your fraud detection must decide **before approving a payment** ‚Üí batch or real-time?  
üëâ Answer: **Real-time inference**.  

---  

## 8. Recap üéâ  

- **Batch inference** = offline, high-throughput jobs.  
- **Real-time inference** = low-latency APIs.  
- **GPUs** = accelerate parallel workloads.  
- **Distributed inference** = scale beyond one machine.  

‚ö° Scaling inference = matching the right method to your workload & infra.
