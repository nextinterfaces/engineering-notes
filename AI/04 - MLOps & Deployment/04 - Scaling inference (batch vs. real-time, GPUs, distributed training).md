# ⚡ Scaling Inference: Batch vs Real-time, CPUs vs GPUs vs TPUs, Distributed Training  

## 1. Why Care About Scaling Inference?  

Imagine opening a burger shop 🍔.  
- If 5 people show up → you’re fine.  
- If 5,000 show up at once → you need serious scaling!  

👉 Same for ML models: inference at scale = key to production success.  

---  

## 2. Two Modes of Inference  

### Batch Inference 🗂️  
- Process many inputs at once (offline).  
- Examples: nightly fraud risk scores, recommendation pre-computation.  

```
[Big dataset] ---> [Batch job] ---> [Predictions stored in DB]
```  

- ✅ Efficient for large datasets.  
- ❌ High latency (not real-time).  

### Real-time Inference ⚡  
- Handle one request at a time, respond immediately.  
- Examples: chatbots, credit card fraud checks, personalized ads.  

```
[User Request] ---> [API/Model] ---> [Instant Response]
```  

- ✅ Low latency.  
- ❌ Requires scalable serving infrastructure.

## 3. CPU vs GPU vs TPU 🖥️🎮⚡  

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)  
- General-purpose processor.  
- Few cores (4–64), optimized for sequential tasks.  
- Great for small/medium ML models, low QPS (queries/sec).  

👉 Pros:  
- Ubiquitous, easy to deploy.  
- Strong single-thread performance.  
- Best for light inference (tabular ML, small models).  

👉 Cons:  
- Limited parallelism.  
- Much slower for large matrix multiplications.  

---  

### GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)  
- Thousands of small cores (CUDA cores).  
- Designed for **massive parallelism** → perfect for matrix multiplications in deep nets.  

👉 Pros:  
- High throughput for deep learning (CNNs, Transformers).  
- Libraries like TensorRT, cuDNN, ONNX Runtime accelerate inference.  
- Ideal for real-time, high-volume workloads.  

👉 Cons:  
- Expensive 💸.  
- Requires batching for efficiency.  
- Less power-efficient than CPUs for small workloads.  

```python
# PyTorch GPU inference
import torch
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = torch.jit.load("model.pt").to(device)
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224).to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    y = model(x)
```  

---  

### TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)  
- Custom ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) built by Google.  
- Designed specifically for tensor operations (matrix multiplies).  
- Optimized for TensorFlow/JAX workloads.  

👉 Pros:  
- Extremely high throughput (petaflop scale).  
- Great for **training & inference of huge models**.  
- Scales seamlessly in Google Cloud TPU pods.  

👉 Cons:  
- Vendor lock-in (Google Cloud).  
- Limited framework support (best with TensorFlow/JAX).  
- Less flexible than GPUs for general workloads.

## 4. Performance Comparison (High-Level)  

| Hardware | Core Count | Strength | Best For | Weakness |
|----------|------------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **CPU** | 4–64 cores | Strong sequential compute | Small/medium models, tabular ML, on-device inference | Poor at massive matrix multiplications |
| **GPU** | 1,000s of cores | Parallel matrix ops | Deep nets (CNNs, Transformers), real-time inference | Expensive, needs batching |
| **TPU** | Matrix units (systolic arrays) | Specialized tensor math | Huge models, large-scale training/inference | Cloud-only, less flexible |  

---  

## 5. Distributed Inference 🖧  

When one machine/GPU/TPU isn’t enough:  
- **Horizontal scaling**: replicate model across servers.  
- **Model parallelism**: split model layers across devices.  
- **Data parallelism**: shard data across GPUs/TPUs.  

### Tools  
- Ray Serve, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving, NVIDIA Triton, Vertex AI (TPUs).  
- Kubernetes for orchestration & autoscaling.  

```python
# Ray Serve scaling example
from ray import serve

@serve.deployment(num_replicas=3)
class Model:
    def __init__(self):
        import joblib
        self.model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
    def __call__(self, request):
        data = request.json()
        pred = self.model.predict([list(data.values())])
        return {"prediction": int(pred[0])}

serve.run(Model.bind())
```

## 6. Text Diagram: Scaling Options  

```
Batch Inference → Offline, efficient, high throughput  
Real-time      → Online, low latency, user-facing  
CPU            → Cheap, general purpose, small jobs  
GPU            → Parallel, deep learning, high throughput  
TPU            → Specialized, cloud-scale, giant models  
Distributed    → Multiple nodes/accelerators for massive scale  
```

## 7. Challenges ⚠️  

- **Latency vs Throughput** trade-offs.  
- **Cost optimization**: CPUs cheap, GPUs costly, TPUs premium.  
- **Load balancing** for real-time APIs.  
- **Monitoring**: latency, error rates, utilization (CPU/GPU/TPU).

## 8. Game Time 🎲  

Q1: Your model processes **1M transactions nightly** → CPU or GPU?  
👉 Answer: **CPU batch inference** (cheaper).  

Q2: Your fraud detection must respond **within 50ms per request** → CPU or GPU?  
👉 Answer: **GPU real-time inference**.  

Q3: You need to serve a **1B parameter Transformer model** at scale → GPU or TPU?  
👉 Answer: **TPU pod (or multi-GPU cluster)**.

## 9. Recap 🎉  

- **Batch inference** = offline, cost-effective, high throughput.  
- **Real-time inference** = online, low-latency.  
- **CPUs** = cheap & general-purpose, small/medium workloads.  
- **GPUs** = parallel compute, great for deep nets.  
- **TPUs** = custom accelerators for massive ML workloads.  
- **Distributed inference** = scale out across devices/nodes.
