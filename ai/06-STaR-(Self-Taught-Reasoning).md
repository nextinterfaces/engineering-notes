*"How LLMs can learn to teach themselves reasoning."*

## 😵 The Problem: Why LLMs Struggle  

LLMs are trained on **predicting the next word** (language modeling).  
That makes them good at conversation, but…  

- ❌ They struggle with **arithmetic word problems**.  
- ❌ Direct fine-tuning on math or reasoning tasks often fails.  

We need something more than just answers.  
We need… **reasoning.**

## 🧩 Enter Chain-of-Thought (CoT)  

**CoT prompting** = Show the model not just the answer, but the **steps in between**.  

```
Q: 3 + 3 = ?  
Reasoning: Start with 3, add 3 more → 6  
A: 6
```  

- ✅ Uses few-shot prompts.  
- ✅ Outperforms direct fine-tuning in some tasks.  
- ❌ Still limited.

## 🌟 Enter Star: Self-Taught Reasoning  

Star = **Fine-tuning with rationales**.  
Instead of *only answers*, the model trains on **questions + reasoning + answers**.  

👉 Like a student who doesn’t just memorize answers but learns to write full solutions.  

---

## ⚙️ How Star Works  

Needs:  
- Pre-trained LLM.  
- Dataset of (Q → A).  
- ~10 seed examples with **Q → Reasoning → A**.

### 🔄 The Two-Step Loop  

```
         ┌──────────────────────────┐
         │  1. Generate Rationale   │
         └───────────┬──────────────┘
                     │
     If Answer ✅    │     If Answer ❌
                     ▼
        Add (Q, R, A) to dataset
                     │
                     ▼
         ┌──────────────────────────┐
         │  2. Rationalize Step     │
         │  (reverse engineer R)    │
         └──────────────────────────┘
                     │
                     ▼
          Add corrected (Q, R, A)
```

This loop expands the dataset with rationales.

### 📚 Training Flow  

```
Seed (10 Q-R-A examples)
        │
        ▼
Generate + Rationalize → Expanded Q-R-A dataset
        │
        ▼
Fine-tune LLM on Q-R-A
        │
        ▼
Model learns reasoning!
```

## 📊 Performance  

- **Arithmetic:** Rationalization accelerates performance on multi-digit addition.  
- **Commonsense QA:** Star ≈ GPT-3, but with a model **30× smaller**.  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations  

1. **Model size matters:** Small models (GPT-2) can’t generate good rationales.  
2. **Rationale quality:** Sometimes answer = right but reasoning = nonsense.  
   - Hard to evaluate what a “good” rationale is.  

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways  

1. **CoT:** Prompt with reasoning → better results.  
2. **Star:** Fine-tune with reasoning → even better.  
3. **Rationalize step:** Wrong answers become learning opportunities.  
4. **Efficiency:** Star = GPT-3-level with much smaller models.  
5. **Limits:** Needs big enough base models + reliable rationales.

💡 Memory Hook:  
CoT = “show your work.”  
Star = “teach yourself to always show your work.”
