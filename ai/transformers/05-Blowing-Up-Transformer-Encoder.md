# 💥 Blowing Up the Transformer Encoder  
*"How raw words become context-packed vectors."*  

---

## 🎯 Big Picture: What the Encoder Does  

Input sentence: `"my name is aj"`  
→ Encoder → Output: 4 context-aware vectors (one per token).  

These vectors = **meaning + context** → sent to decoder for translation.  

```
Input words → Encoder → Context-rich vectors → Decoder → Translation
```

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Input Preparation  

1. **Tokenization + Padding:**  
   - Sentence chopped into tokens (or word pieces).  
   - Padded with dummy tokens → fixed length.  

2. **One-Hot Encoding:**  
   - Each token → giant sparse vector.  

3. **Embedding:**  
   - One-hot → 512-dim dense vector.  
   - Learned via backprop.  

4. **Positional Encoding:**  
   - Add sin/cos patterns → inject word order.  

```
Embedding (512) + Position (512) = Position-aware embedding (512)
```

## 🧠 Step 2: Multi-Head Self-Attention  

Each token embedding → split into:  

- Q (Query): what am I looking for?  
- K (Key): what info do I have?  
- V (Value): what I actually pass on.  

```
Token → [Q, K, V]
```

### The Flow  

1. Compute **Q·Kᵀ** → affinity between words.  
2. Scale by √d → stabilize.  
3. Softmax → turn into probabilities.  
4. Multiply by V → context vectors.  

### Multi-Head Trick  

- 512 dims split into 8 heads → each 64-dim.  
- Each head learns different relationships.  
- Outputs (8 × 64) concatenated back → 512-dim vector.  

```
Head1 + Head2 + ... + Head8 → Concatenate → 512-dim
```

## 🔗 Step 3: Add & Norm #1 (Post-Attention)  

1. **Residual Connection:**  
   - Attention output + original input (skip path).  
   - Prevents vanishing gradients.  

2. **Layer Normalization:**  
   - Normalize activations (mean=0, std≈1).  
   - Learnable γ, β scale/shift.  

```
Output1 = LayerNorm( Attention + Input )
```

---

## 🔧 Step 4: Feed-Forward + Add & Norm #2  

1. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN):**  
   - Linear expand (512 → 1024)  
   - ReLU + Dropout  
   - Compress back (1024 → 512)  

2. **Residual Connection:**  
   - FFN output + previous output.  

3. **Layer Normalization:**  
   - Normalize again.  

```
Output2 = LayerNorm( FFN( Output1 ) + Output1 )
```

## 🔄 Step 5: Stacking Layers  

- One encoder block = all steps above.  
- In practice → **12+ stacked encoders**.  
- Each layer refines context further.  

```
[Input Embeddings]
     │
┌────▼────┐
│ Encoder │ × 12 layers
└────▼────┘
     │
[Context-rich vectors → Decoder]
```

---

## 📝 Key Takeaways  

1. **Embedding + Position** → word meaning + order.  
2. **Multi-Head Attention** → every token attends to all others.  
3. **Add & Norm** → stable training + skip paths.  
4. **Feed-Forward** → non-linear mixing, then normalize again.  
5. **Stacked Encoders** → progressively richer word representations.

💡 Memory Hook:  
**Encoder = assembly line:**  
- Embed words → Add positions → Mix context (attention) → Refine (FFN) → Repeat.
